# Jumper

The puzzle is a secret word randomly chosen from a list. The player guesses a letter in the puzzle. If the guess is correct, the letter is revealed. If the guess is incorrect, a line is cut on the player's parachute. If the puzzle is solved the game is over. If the player has no more parachute the game is over.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.10.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and
browse to the project's jumper folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the
project folder. Select the main module inside the jumper folder and click the "run" button.
